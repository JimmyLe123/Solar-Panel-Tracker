# Solar-Panel-Tracker
Made a product that will track the sun(or in this case, a light) using photoresistors and a pair of servo motors in order to provide 2 degrees of freedom.. By tracking the intensity of sunlight with the aid of the photoresistors, the motor will be able to move to a position which will make the panel perpendicular to the sunlight.
